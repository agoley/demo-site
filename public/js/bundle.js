The GTG-F assists program managers, portfolio managers, engineers, and others in answering two questions critical to any IT or National Security Systems (NSS): (1) Where does the IT or NSS fit, as both a provider and consumer, into the GIG with regard to End-to-End technical performance, access to data and services, and interoperability?; and (2) What must an IT system or NSS do to ensure technical interoperability with the GIG?
